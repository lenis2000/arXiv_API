# arXiv_API

A python script based on [arXiv.org](https://www.arxiv.org) API to track new papers by the [Integrable Probability FRG](https://integrable-probability.github.io/)

## Usage

Run the script, git ignore the undesired papers (because arXiv search does not do a good job distinguishing authors), 
and put (checkout) the remaining .md files into blog/_posts
